# GoGreen Smart web application powered by Recycli Android App

**By Team Jarvis**

## Overview

GoGreen is a web application that aims at knitting individuals together to prevent the further deterioration of our environment. As the environment has become our second priority and deforestation is escalating horribly, our main motive is to encourage afforestation, because tree plantation is itself the best talisman to counter environmental degradation.We achieve our target through various features that we have integrated into our website, viz. 

- Events- This is a very important platform where individuals get to know about different ongoing events and also host one if they are interested and can witness their small efforts solving gargantuan real world problems.

- Issues- Users will be using this feature to raise any issue that they face in their surroundings, like garbage collected on roadsides, mass destruction of trees, vehicles emitting too much of black smoke, industries in residential areas causing hazardous air pollution etc. We will fight together and solve every problem within our capacity instead of just ranting and waiting for authorities to take any step.

- Challenges- Challenges will help us develop a habit, a habit to protect our environment, which will include planting a certain number of trees/plants for a given period of time, participating in public events, challenge to clean a place which got attention of curse only. They not only contribute to the environment but also etch the sense of satisfaction and happiness within us.

- GoGreen box- Todayâ€™s irony is that money leads to destruction and the same money helps in conservation and preservation. GoGreen box aims to raise funds with individuals who want to participate in this campaign. This fund will help to increase the use of renewable energy and run out different events effectively.

- Breathe healthy- This platform gives all the details you should know about the oxygen you are breathing, and, not even realising how harmful it is. It is also an idea to realise everyone that we all are responsible for this and instantly act towards it.

It is really high time we realise the urgency to act towards saving our nature. If we join hands, we can reverse the situation and we strongly believe - Together We Can and Together We Will! And for this, today we present one complete solution, our web-application GoGreen.
